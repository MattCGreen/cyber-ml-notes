I have been taking tme to get used to learning things in doses as opposed to the usual "drink through a firehose" I'm used to.
Making my way through the Google ML course has been teaching me a lot.
Today I was able to successfully set up two virtual machines: one was Alpine Linux and the other was for Kali.
I finished Ethan Mollick's Co-Intelligence and found that I didn't want to just plow through the book all at once. I took a few extra days to just sit with those concepts.
Looking ahead, I am excited to continue my work on the Google ML course and see how I can take small steps in my working knowledge of virtual machines.
