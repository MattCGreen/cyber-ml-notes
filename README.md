# cyber-ml-notes
Notes on cybersecurity, machine learning, and more. 

This is my public learning journal and personal knowledge base. It documents my growth across cybersecurity, cloud, AI/ML, and compliance. Most notes are simplified, step-by-step, and written in my own words to reinforce learning.

### 📚 Topics

- 🔐 Cyber Labs: TryHackMe, Hack The Box, CTFs
- 🧰 Tools: Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit
- ☁️ Cloud + Compliance: AWS, FedRAMP, NIST 800-53
- 🤖 AI/ML for Security: notebooks + concepts
- 🗓️ Journal: daily/weekly reflections, troubleshooting, fixes

### 🛠️ How I Use This Repo

- Each week I focus on a theme (see `journal/`)
- Notes are mostly `.md` or `.ipynb` for clarity and flexibility
- Some files are rough, don't mind the mess.
